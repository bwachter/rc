Highlights of changes since rc-1.6.  See ChangeLog for further details.

Portability.  Many minor tweaks, including fixes for BeOS, CygWin,
QNX, and gcc-3.

Bug fixes.  A number of bugs have been fixed.  The serious ones were:
a core dump, triggered by `~ () '*''; premature exit, triggered by
sourcing a file which could be open()ed but not read() (such as a
directory on many systems); uninterruptible looping, triggered by
semantic errors in `fn prompt'; deficiencies in the `limit' builtin.

New features.  The following features are new: the `$version' variable
replaces the `-V' flag; the `-I' flag (definitively not interactive)
was added for compatibility with the Plan 9 rc; ASCII SOH (^A) is now
handled transparently; support for large files; support for more
process resource limits.

Documentation.  Distributions of this rc used to include a PostScript
paper given by Tom Duff to the UKUUG, describing the Plan 9 rc.  This
paper is no longer distributed with rc, but instead is available on
the web, both in its original PostScript version, and an updated HTML
version.
