Highlights of changes since rc-1.7.  See ChangeLog for further details.

Portability.  A fix to the autoconfiguration means that the nasty
longjmp() code is now omitted for all modern Unix systems; previously
rc only did the Right Thing on Linux.  The test for large files in
trip.rc was removed, as this causes indigestion on file systems that
don't support sparse files (the configuration and implementation of
large file support is still present of course).

Bug fixes.  Broken symlinks now glob correctly. The variables $prompt
and $version are now exported if they are inherited from the
environment when rc starts.  EIO handling is now enabled for readline
too.  A few bogosities in the history program were fixed.

New features.  None - this is a bugfix release.

Documentation.  Minor updates only.
