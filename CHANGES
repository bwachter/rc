Changes since 1.2: (Too many to count!)

A memory stomping bug was fixed (provoked by assigning a variable
to its old value plus something else).

Better signal handling; a real signal handler which manages a queue
of pending signals was added.

rc now ignores SIGQUIT and traps SIGINT even in non-interactive
mode. Thus,

	rc ed.sh

will not do mysterious things if the shell script "ed.sh" calls a
command like "ed" and then you hit ^C.

rc now opens 0, 1, 2 on /dev/null if they are inherited closed.
rc -o prevents this.

A couple of stupid O(n^2) string appends were replaced with O(n)
loops. This should make foo=`{cat /etc/termcap} bar=$^foo a little
faster :-)

Returning a list of signals from a function is now legal, so "return
$status" should always work.

The code has been revised, new printing routines have been added.

rc no longer uses redundant braces when exporting functions.

A first stab at a verification suite has been added (trip.rc).
(someone, please help me make this comprehensive!)

rc -p now does not initialize functions from the environment. This
should make it easier to write shell scripts that don't need to
assume anything about the environment.

Inherited ignored signals are now ignored in the current shell and
passed on ignored to the child processes. whatis -s also reflects
this information.

A file descriptor leak in the /dev/fd implementation of >{} was
fixed.

A variable set to '' was not imported from the environment; this
has been fixed.

Changes since 1.3beta:

New Makefile/config.h setup.

builtin echo may now be conditionally included out, to use a Goldwynism.

builtin exit takes any legal exit status. If the status is not all zeros,
rc exits with 1. (having "exit sigiot" produce a core dump would be going
a little far, I think.)

limit does not append a unit after a zero limit; 0g was too confusing.

exec > /nonexistentfile does not cause rc to exit any more.

If a noninteractive rc is started with sigint ignored, rc does not install
its own signal handler.

error messages produced by rc in a subshell were cleaned up. (rc erroneously
reset the 'interactive' flag after a fork)

print.c was cleaned up a little; no functionality was changed, but should
be more portable now.

a bug in rc-1.3beta (not previous versions) was fixed: setting the first
element of $path to '' caused PATH to be exported as '':etc..

getopt's "illegal option" message was gratuitously changed to something
less abrupt.

some dead code was removed from input.c

%term was changed to %token in parse.y; apparently newer yacc's don't grok
%term any more.

a race condition in the signal handler was fixed.

the variable in for() was getting evaluated each time through the loop
(e.g., for (`{echo i;date>[1=2]} in 1 2 3)echo $i would print the date
three times). This was cleaned up.

a redundant fork() was removed from walk.c; this showed up when running
a braced command with a redirection in the background. e.g., {a;b}>c&

man pages for history and rc were cleaned up by david (thanks).

rc set SIGQUIT and SIGTERM to SIG_DFL on background jobs---even when
trying to do old-style backgrounding (i.e., don't use process groups,
just ignore SIGINT & SIGQUIT & SIGTERM).

$0 is now changed to the name of the signal when entering a signal
handler. Thus it's possible to write code like

	fn sigint sigterm sigquit {
		switch ($0) {
		case sigint
			...
		case sigterm
			...

wait with no arguments now prints the pid of any and all children
that died with a signal. e.g.,

	; wait
	25321: terminated
	25325: terminated

as opposed to

	; wait
	terminated

An error saving/restoring state in the input stream code would
cause rc to exit with the (erroneous) command:

	eval '|[a'

FIFO's were not removed in a backgrounded command, e.g.,

	cat <{echo hi}&

Changes since rc-1.4beta:

getopt was renamed to rc_getopt to avoid libc collisions.

$cdpath with a / in it caused a cd to sometimes have two //'s at the
front of the path. This is reserved by POSIX, so I changed it to skip
one of the /'s.

signal handling now emulates sh in the way I described in a previous
message: the race condition present in older rc's whereby some SIGINTs
got lost is now gone; any SIGINT received during a wait() is acted upon
at the end of the wait(), unless of course SIGINT is being deliberately
ignored.

getopt was renamed to avoid naming conflicts with libc. Also a sound
move since rc_getopt is no longer quite libc-getopt compatible; I had
to add in a mechanism for resetting getopt.

signal handler code in fn.c was cleaned up; there were several bugs
in rc-1.4beta, notably the shell sometimes spawned background jobs
with SIGTERM ignored. I took the opportunity to make things a little
cleaner here.

a quasi-memory leak in the code for while() was fixed: a long-running
while that had rc commands allocating memory in it could cause the
shell to grow without bounds. I fixed this by placing the while loop
(*and* test!) inside a new allocation arena each time through the loop.

A new configuration parameter, NOJOB, was added to allow you to force
v7-style backgrounding (no setpgrp, ignore SIGINT and SIGTERM).

The FIFO code was reworked a little. It should be more robust now---
FIFOs get removed at the end of the command of the argument list
that they were on:

		fn foo {echo $*; cat $*}
		foo<{echo hi}

now works as expected. Also FIFO names are pushed onto the exception
stack so that their removal occurs in the face of exceptions and so
on.

A memory leak in treefree() was plugged up --- the root node of a
function was not getting freed.

Changes since rc-1.4:

General changes:

        Some small memory leaks/uninit references revealed by Purify.

        $bqstatus for querying the exit status of a backquote.

        Globbing through unreadable directories.

        More options to whatis.

        History append which always re-opens the file (avoids
        inconsistencies over multiple NFS-mounted accesses to
        $history).

        Support "rc -s".

Changes since rc-1.5beta1

	Configuration: rc now uses GNU autoconf.

	Portability: mksignal works on HPUX 10.

	Portability: resources can be (quad_t).

	Bug: if rc was started with SIGCLD == SIG_IGN (e.g. by Solaris's
	rshd) it would loop.  Fixed by resetting SIGCLD to SIG_DFL if it
	was SIG_IGN when rc was started.

	Portability: POSIXish systems don't have NGROUPS.
